# Portfolio

PROBLEM: I needed a website to show off my work, experience, personality, contacts, hobbies, etc.



SOLUTION: I created a responsive and beautiful website that showcased everything you'd need to know:

|| My Web Dev Portfolio ||

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SCSS

-Visitors can browse my portfolio, find other socials, explore my projects, learn about my interests and my journey, etc.

## Optimizations (*Contributions Welcome*)

-Add more dynamic elements, like with transitions and such
-Add new projects
-Add a skills and technologies/tools section with cards for everything I am familiar with

## Lessons Learned:

-Don't overnest SASS variables as those files can get extremely large and hard to debug
